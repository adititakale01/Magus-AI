Hi Anna,

Thanks for your inquiry. To provide an accurate quote, 
I need a few more details:

1. Which city in China? (e.g., Shanghai, Ningbo, Shenzhen)
2. Where in Poland? (e.g., Gdansk, Warsaw)
3. How much cargo? (weight and volume, or container size)
4. Sea freight or air freight?

Looking forward to your reply.

Best regards
```

## Possible Rate (if clarified as Shanghai → Gdansk, 40ft)
**File:** `01_rates_easy.xlsx` → $3,600 + 15% = $4,140 per 40ft
