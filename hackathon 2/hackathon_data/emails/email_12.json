  "body": "Hi,\n\nFollowing up on the below. We need air freight rates ASAP.\n\nOriginal request was for Shanghai to Rotterdam but customer now says maybe Ningbo is better? Can you quote both?\n\nAlso they mentioned 40ft container but actually I think they need air because it's urgent. Weight is around 500kg, maybe 600kg, volume approximately 3-4 CBM.\n\nPlease advise which is cheaper - sea or air?\n\nThanks,\nSarah\n\n--- Original Message ---\nSubject: container rates\n\nNeed 40ft to Rotterdam"
